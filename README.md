# Steganography-python2 
Steganography is technique of hiding data into images for secure cmmunication. Here issome code Implementing that using python2.


## Histogram Intersection 
Histogram intersection calculates the similarity of two discretized probability distributions (histograms), with possible value of the intersection lying between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (identical distributions).
histogram intersection is a way to comapre similarity between cover image and stego image.

## Lossless Compression
Lossless compression is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. Means no information would be lost during decompression of data.

Huffman Encoding is a famous greedy algorithm that is used for the lossless compression of data. It uses variable length encoding where variable length codes are assigned to all the pixels depending on how frequently they occur in the given image.
